The speakers are a combination of people with a passion for software engineering and software testing. Each has researched the field of pseudo-tested methods extensively and have presented at the PyCon Education Summit on a different subject. Also each speaker has an advanced understanding of the Python language and the Pytest framework. One of the speakers is an award-winning educator with twenty years of experience in teaching software engineering and software testing to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. Collaborating with a diverse and highly skilled group of students and colleagues, this speaker has given presentations at a wide variety of conferences for researchers and developers, including the International Conference on Software Testing, PyOhio, PyGotham, and as well as previously mentioned, the PyCon Education Summit. Along with teaching courses and conducting research, the speaker implements, tests, documents, and debugs open-source software available on GitHub.

Since the speakers are not allowed to submit personally identifiable information, this content is abbreviated. If this presentation proposal advances to the next round of review, the speakers will provide more details about prior speaking experience and furnish links to relevant web sites, blog posts, and videos.
